**Visa**
The entry of foreigners into Brazil is regulated by immigration laws, and each country has its own rules and requirements. The entry of foreigners into Brazil has specific procedures depending on the country of origin, **which may require a visa to enter the country**.
The list of all countries that have bilateral visa relations can be accessed [here](https://www.gov.br/mre/pt-br/assuntos/portal-consular/QGRVsimplesport24MAR231.pdf). Maximum stay of 90 days within every 180 days.

However, there are countries whose citizens need to obtain a visa before traveling to Brazil. These visas can be for tourism, study, work, or residence purposes where the citizen holds a common visa. Some examples of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter Brazil include China, India, and some countries in Africa and the Middle East, such as Afghanistan, Angola, Saudi Arabia, Cape Verde, and Syria.
To obtain a visa for Brazil, the process generally involves the following steps, which are also described in this [link](https://www.gov.br/pt-br/servicos/obter-visto-para-viajar-ao-brasil#etapas-para-a-realizacao-deste-servico).
