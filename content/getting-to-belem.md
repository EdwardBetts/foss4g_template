**Boat**

In addition to access by air, the city has an excellent structure for river transport. The Port of Belém connects with other destinations in the north of Brazil, such as Manaus, Santarém and Macapá.
Those who want to visit Belém can also invest in boat trips, such as the famous crossing from Manaus to Belém, which passes through Santarém (gateway to Alter do Chão) and Marajó. It may not be a quick way to get there, but it is certainly a wonderful trip that is worth every minute and every view of this experience. There are several companies that carry out the route. We made the trip between Santarém and Belém with the Amazon Star ship. The same boat makes the trip from Manaus and Belém.

**Public transport**  
The city public transport is in the process of being improved with the creation of the BRT system (Bus Rapid Transit Belém) and therefore many streets are experiencing traffic changes.
There are alternatives besides the bus, like cycle lanes, taxis or mobility services (such as Uber). To access the surrounding islands you need to take small boats (voadeiras) to cross the islands.
